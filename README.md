The user can receive this data while online or ‘offline’ submission using cellular or sms messaging. Upon submission of their location, we provide them with a customized map of their surrondings marked with nearby dangers and stores.


The map image is sent over data, retrieved through our server, or through sms message as a picture for users without cellular data.

We also used the user data to  create a command map for headquarters to distribute first responders.
